This segment has seen a rise in demand as more individuals prioritize oral health and seek regular dental visits. Preventive measures facilitated by these units include fluoride treatments, sealants, and patient education, all aimed at maintaining dental hygiene and preventing more severe conditions. Enhanced technology in dental treatment units, such as integrated digital imaging and automated cleaning systems, supports this application by improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency, thereby driving market expansion in preventive dentistry.</p><p>Another key application of dental treatment units is in restorative dentistry, which involves procedures aimed at repairing and restoring damaged or missing teeth.
